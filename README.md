# Fake GPay Clone â€“ Raising Awareness of QR Payment Scams

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer
**This project is for educational and awareness purposes only.**  
It is NOT intended for fraudulent activities. The goal is to highlight the risks of relying solely on payment success screens for transaction verification.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
In many cities, small vendors and auto-rickshaw (TukTuk) drivers use QR codes for digital payments. However, many of them verify payments just by looking at the "Payment Success" screen without checking SMS confirmations or transaction history.

To demonstrate how this can be exploited, I created a **fake GPay clone** that:
âœ… Scans and processes QR codes like a real payment app  
âœ… Generates a realistic "Payment Success" screen with animations  
âœ… Mimics GPay UI elements to look genuine  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project was built to **raise awareness** about digital payment fraud and encourage merchants to adopt proper verification methods.

## ðŸ”’ How to Protect Yourself
If you accept QR payments:
1. **Check the SMS notification** â€“ Always verify bank messages for payments.  
2. **Use a payment speaker** â€“ Enable audio confirmation for real-time alerts.  
3. **Verify transaction history** â€“ Check payments in your own app instead of relying on the customerâ€™s screen.  
4. **Educate yourself and others** â€“ Awareness is key to preventing scams.
